# **📘 LeetCode Kata Progress**

This repository is part of my personal journey to become a **better and more thoughtful programmer**, under my long-term project called **ARCH**.

Here, I consistently upload my **solutions to LeetCode problems** (Katas), with a focus on **understanding deeply, learning from mistakes, and growing daily.**

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

The goal isn't just to grind through problems — it's to **truly understand** algorithms, patterns, and data structures, and to **document my learning** through both successes and failures.

I aim to solve **at least 4 problems per day**, but I never rush. When I make mistakes, I analyze them, take notes, and share them here — because **mistakes are the best feedback**.

This repo is more than just solutions — it's my **public learning journal**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Plan

- I started with **Java** as my main language to strengthen my OOP and logic foundations.
- In **3–5 months**, I plan to **switch to C++** to dive deeper into memory management, low-level optimizations, and performance-based problem solving.
- My long-term goal is to **complete all LeetCode problems** (currently over 2,000+) in **33 months**, at my own pace — focusing on quality over speed.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Sharpen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Build strong fundamentals in data structures and system design.
- Prepare for real-world coding interviews and technical roles.
- Learn from my mistakes and share those learnings openly.
- Stay consistent, intentional, and curious throughout the process.
- Contribute to the ARCH project as a collection of focused, real learning experiences.
